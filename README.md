<p>The next assignment in the programming journey seems to be a step up 
in what we have done previously. This feels like what i thought programming was
before i started.</p>

<p>It's been almost 4 months since i started the Odin Project, i don't know how much time i have dedicated to it, but it has been quite a ride. I still don't know where i want to go with this, i'm trying to learn just for the sake of learn something new so my brain makes new connections, but also i'm learning something that i find fascinating.</p>

<p>This is my first JavaScript assignment, and already seems to be a not so easy one, i'm struggling to understand JavaScript, i was thinking that HTML and CSS where somehow easy to get a hold of them, but JS is in another league. Let's see how it goes. Today is Thursday, Sept 4th 2025, it's 10 in the morning and my cats Emilio and Katchoo are in the home office with me, accompanying my learning while napping under the sun.</p>
